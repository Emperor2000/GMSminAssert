MinAssert is a minimal unit testing framework for GML. It introduces a number of scripts that you can use for 
common unit testing purposes. 

===============
Assertions
===============
AssertTrue
AssertFalse
AssertEquals
AssertNotEquals
AssertGreaterThan
AssertSmallerThan
AssertPositive
AssertNegative




Each of these assertions returns a String which is built in the following format:
Note <> is not included in the actual unit test results.

<ResultValue> : <ResultNotification>

Where ResultValue is true, false or Error if the value is undefined.

Where ResultNotification is a log message that can provide some more information, which can be one of the following:
"ERROR: Test input was invalid!"
"SUCCESS: Expected was <expected>, actual was <actual>"
"FAIL: Expected was <expected>, actual was <actual>"




=========================
I might add some more functionality later, such as the following:
=========================
AssertArrayContains
AssertArrayNotContains
AssertMapContains
AssertMapNotContains
AssertArraySorted
AssertArrayNotSorted
AssertNull
AssertNotNull
